<h3>Command Injection - 1 vulnerabilities found</h3>
<p>Description: Command injection is an attack in which an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, and system compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>URL: http://192.168.232.129:80/mutillidae/index.php?page=dns-lookup.php</p>
<p>&emsp;Payload: ;cat /etc/passwd</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remediation Steps:
1. Use whitelisting to restrict the set of allowed commands and parameters.
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Recent Command Injection CVE's:</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2023-6634</p>
<p>Description: The LearnPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Command Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.5.7 via the get_content function. This is due to the plugin making use of the call_user_func function with user input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute any public function with one parameter, which could result in remote code execution.</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2023-51126</p>
<p>Description: Command injection vulnerability in /usr/www/res.php in FLIR AX8 up to 1.46.16 allows attackers to run arbitrary commands via the value parameter.</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2023-51972</p>
<p>Description: Tenda AX1803 v1.0.0.1 was discovered to contain a command injection vulnerability via the function fromAdvSetLanIp.</p>

<h3>Reflected Cross Site Scripting - 2 vulnerabilities found</h3>
<p>Description: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web application, which are then reflected back to the user's browser. This can lead to client-side code execution and various security risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>URL: http://192.168.232.129:80/mutillidae/index.php?page=dns-lookup.php</p>
<p>&emsp;Payload: &lt;scrIpt&gt;alert(&#x27;XSS&#x27;)&lt;/sCriPt&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL: http://192.168.232.129:80/mutillidae/index.php?page=login.php</p>
<p>&emsp;Payload: &lt;scrIpt&gt;alert(&#x27;XSS&#x27;)&lt;/sCriPt&gt;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remediation Steps:
1. Encode user input to prevent malicious scripts from executing.
2. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources of executable scripts.</p>
<p>Recent Reflected Cross Site Scripting CVE's:</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2024-0314</p>
<p>Description: XSS vulnerability in FireEye Central Management affecting version 9.1.1.956704, which could allow an attacker to modify special HTML elements in the application and cause a reflected XSS, leading to a session hijacking.</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2023-51064</p>
<p>Description: QStar Archive Solutions Release RELEASE_3-0 Build 7 Patch 0 was discovered to contain a DOM Based reflected XSS vulnerability within the component qnme-ajax?method=tree_table.</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2024-22142</p>
<p>Description: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Cozmoslabs Profile Builder Pro allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Profile Builder Pro: from n/a through 3.10.0.

<h3>Stored Cross Site Scripting - 0 vulnerabilities found</h3>
<br>
<h3>Remote File Inclusion - 0 vulnerabilities found</h3>
<br>
<h3>Local File Inclusion - 2 vulnerabilities found</h3>
<p>Description: Local file inclusion (LFI) is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files on a server through the web browser. This can lead to information disclosure and remote code execution.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>URL: http://192.168.232.129:80/mutillidae/index.php?page=%2Fetc%2Fpasswd</p>
<p>&emsp;Payload: /etc/passwd</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL: http://192.168.232.129/mutillidae/index.php?page=%2Fetc%2Fpasswd</p>
<p>&emsp;Payload: /etc/passwd</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remediation Steps:
1. Avoid passing user-controlled input directly to file inclusion functions.
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitize file paths to prevent LFI vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Recent Local File Inclusion CVE's:</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2024-1644</p>
<p>Description: Suite CRM version 7.14.2 allows including local php files. This is possible

because the application is vulnerable to LFI.



</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2021-24566</p>
<p>Description: The WooCommerce Currency Switcher FOX WordPress plugin before 1.3.7 was vulnerable to LFI attacks via the "woocs" shortcode.</p>
<p>CVE ID: CVE-2023-49715</p>
<p>Description: A unrestricted php file upload vulnerability exists in the import.json.php temporary copy functionality of WWBN AVideo dev master commit 15fed957fb. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary code execution when chained with an LFI vulnerability. An attacker can send a series of HTTP requests to trigger this vulnerability.</p>
